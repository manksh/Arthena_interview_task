We have over 20 features that describe the artwork, the prices, the timestamps etc. For any model, Its  good quality features that make or break it, thus it makes sense to spend enough time to engineer good predictive features else the garbage in will just be gerbage out. Feature engineering involves using the current features to first get rid/impute unknowns, deal with outliers and hypothesize the predictive power of features. "

This is needed to validate the model at later stages and have a way to split the data into train/validation/test so that the model can be robust. Its not clear from the data what the present date is. To make the model robust, I train on datapoints before 2017 and test on points after this date. Then for auctions in the future, I give predictions but its not possible to evaluate these predictions as they are in the future and we dont know what they would actually sell for.\n",

The estimate low also has a high correlation but that may be due to its correlation with the estimate high. Now, correlation does not convey any causation, however, the estimated high is based on analyses by industry experts and that having a high correlation with our target variable is a good start. The high estimate will also be inflation adjusted similar to how hammer price would be.\n",

    "The birth and death year of the artist are very important quantities to look at, however, our dataset only has 3 different artists, i.e. we have only 6 different years. We can however get a little clever with this feature. I would first include `alive_at_auction` (relative to when the auction took place) as a feature and if this feature is false, I think that the days between the death of artist and the auction date together would be important, this transformed feature would be called: `death_auction_diff`, this could be a possibly telling feature of the data. There is a small problem with this feature- if an artist is not dead, this we cannot compute this. Thus, in that case, I would give an unknown value like 0.\n",

I would combine this feature by converting this as a ratio of lot_place_in_auction relative to auction_lot_count. This would be called `relative_lot_position`. This feature may or may not turn out to be useful,  but apriori it seems like it can be a good addition to the model as the assumption is that if an artpiece is sold at the end of an auction, its the 'masterpiece of the auction' and thus may fetch a higher price, or it can also mean that if the lot is very big and the artpiece is the first one, people are willing to spend less as they are waiting for future pieces.

For 3d art, it would be the volume of the piec( length * width * height) as it would be very hard to calculate the surface area of sculptures due to the many different shapes. For unknown values, i replace it with avg. This is however very hard to do, a majority of the units of measurement is missing and calculating area in two different units then becomes impossible. I also try calculating the `aspect_ratio` of a 2d artwork.\n",
